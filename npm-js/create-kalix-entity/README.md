# create-kalix-entity

This repository provides the `create-kalix-entity` tool to support Kalix development with the npm/JavaScript toolchain.

## Usage

This tool can be used to generate a project suitable for the general development of
[Kalix](https://kalix.io) applications.

There are two templates available to select from:

- `value-entity` (default); provides the starting point to develop a [Value Entity](https://docs.akkaserverless.dev/js-services/value-entity.html)
- `event-sourced-entity`; provides the starting point to develop an [Event Sourced Entity](https://docs.akkaserverless.dev/js-services/eventsourced.html)

To create the initial codebase for a new entity with npm:

```sh
npx @kalix-io/create-kalix-entity@latest my-entity --template value-entity
cd my-entity
npm install
npm run build
```

Or using Yarn:

```sh
yarn create @kalix-io/kalix-entity@latest my-entity --template value-entity
cd my-entity
yarn
yarn build
```

This module will be included as a dependency of the created project, providing the `kalix-codegen-js` tool binary for your platform.

## Building

To build and test locally, first install:

```sh
npm install
```

...then package:

```sh
npm pack
```

...and then install locally (substituting <some-version> with the version that the above `npm pack` reports):

```sh
npm install -g lightbend-create-kalix-entity-<some-version>.tgz
```

As the `create-kalix-entity` command is now locally installed, you are able to run:

```sh
create-kalix-entity my-entity
```
