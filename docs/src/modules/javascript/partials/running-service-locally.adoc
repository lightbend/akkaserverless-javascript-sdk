Running a service locally is helpful to test and debug. The following sections provide commands for starting and stopping a single service locally.

In order to run your service locally, you must run the Akka Serverless proxy, which we provide as a Docker image. The examples include `docker compose` files with the configuration required to run the proxy for a locally running application.
It also contains the configuration to start a local Google Pub/Sub emulator that the Akka Serverless proxy will connect to when you make use of xref:javascript:topic-eventing.adoc[] in your service.

== Pre-requisites

* Docker {minimum_docker_version} or higher installed and accessible on your local computer
* Access to the `gcr.io/akkaserverless-public` docker registry from your local computer
* Your service container image.

== Starting the service

To start the proxy, run the following command from the directory with the `docker-compose.yml` file:

. Start the proxy
+
[.tabset]
Mac and Windows::
+
--
[source, command line]
----
docker compose up
----
--

Linux::
+
--
[source, command line]
----
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.linux.yml up
----
--

+
. Start the service
+
[source, command line]
----
npm start
----

== Exercise the service

Now the service is ready to accept commands on `localhost:9000`.

Use curl to call your service via HTTP, or https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl[grpcurl] to use the gRPC endpoints directly.

This `curl` command calls the "CounterService" from the kickstart example, you will need to adapt it depending on the API of your service.

[.tabset]
Linux or macOS::
+
--
[source,command line]
----
curl \
  -XPOST \ <1>
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ <2>
  -d '{"counterId": "foo"}' \ <3>
  localhost:9000/com.example.CounterService/GetCurrentCounter <4>
----
--
Windows 10+::
+
--
[source,command line]
----
curl ^
  -XPOST ^ <1>
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^ <2>
  -d '{"counterId": "foo"}' ^ <3>
  localhost:9000/com.example.CounterService/GetCurrentCounter <4>
----
--

The `curl` command takes

<1> a flag to send a POST request,
<2> set the content type to JSON,
<3> the message in JSON format,
<4> the URL with the RPC procedure name which deducts from the protobuf definition of the component we're calling.

All Akka Serverless APIs are exposed as regular HTTP endpoints which you can call with `curl`. Protobuf annotations allow controlling the mapping to HTTP as discussed in xref:javascript:proto.adoc#_transcoding_http[Transcoding HTTP].

This `grpcurl` command line calls the same "Counter Service", from the kickstart example, you will need to adapt it depending on the API of your service.

[.tabset]
Linux or macOS::
+
--
[source,command line]
----
grpcurl \
  -d '{"counterId": "foo"}' \ <1>
  -plaintext localhost:9000 \ <2>
  com.example.CounterService/GetCurrentCounter <3>
----
--
Windows 10+::
+
--
[source,command line]
----
grpcurl ^
  -d '{"counterId": "foo"}' ^ <1>
  -plaintext localhost:9000 ^ <2>
  com.example.CounterService/GetCurrentCounter <3>
----
--

The `grpcurl` command takes

<1> the message in JSON format with `-d`,
<2> the address to the proxy (using plain text instead of TLS),
<3> and the RPC procedure name which deducts from the protobuf definition of the component we're calling.


== Shut down the proxy

The command below shows how to shut down the proxy. Shutting down the proxy removes all data, which is kept in memory.

[source, command line]
----
docker stop akkaserverless-proxy
----

To delete the proxy container

[source, command line]
----
docker rm akkaserverless-proxy
----

Replacing quick and easy but leaving the detailed step through for now - maybe another doc?
From a command prompt, create Docker network. The following creates a network named `akkasls-lan`, but you can use any name.

[source, command line]
----
docker network create -d bridge akkasls-lan
----

Retrieve the image id of your service image with the `docker images` command:

[source, command line]
----
$ docker images | grep shopping-cart
myuser/shopping-cart           1.32     f30694769aab   2 hours ago    177MB
myuser/shopping-cart           latest   f30694769aab   2 hours ago    177MB
----


Run your service container in Docker. In the following example, the container name is `shopping-cart`, the service container image id is `f30694769aab`, and it connects to the `akkasls-lan` network we created earlier.

[source, command line]
----
docker run -d --name shopping-cart --network akkasls-lan f30694769aab
----

Use Docker inspect to retrieve the address of the running container in the range of the `akkasls-lan` network.

[source, command line]
----
service_address=$(docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' shopping-cart)
----

Start the https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/reference/glossary.html#_proxy_[_proxy_].

[source, command line, subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run -d --name akkaserverless-proxy --network akkasls-lan -p 9000:9000 \
  --env USER_FUNCTION_HOST=$service_address \
  gcr.io/akkaserverless-public/akkaserverless-proxy:{akkaserverless-proxy-version}

----


The parameters to this command include:

- The proxy image that contains the functional sub-set we need for local testing.
- A connection to the `akkasls-lan` network that exposes the proxy to the 9000 port of the docker host.
- The environment variable `USER_FUNCTION_HOST`, set to the service container's address. The proxy uses this IP to connect to the user function.

Now we can inspect the logs of the proxy to see if it found the service `order`:

[source, command line]
----
docker logs akkaserverless-proxy
----

The following line in the log is written when the proxy registers the Entities of the service.

[source, text]
----
2021-01-08 07:11:03.779 com.akkaserverless.proxy.DiscoveryManager - Received Spec from user function with info...
----

The following line, which should be at the bottom of the startup portion of the log, shows that the proxy now accepts connections on the address '0.0.0.0:9000'

[source, text]
----
2021-01-08 07:11:04.290 INFO io.akkaserverless.proxy.DiscoveryManager - Akka Serverless proxy online at /0.0.0.0:9000

----


Finally, delete the `akkasls-lan` network used by the containers.

[source, command line]
----
docker network rm akkasls-lan
----
