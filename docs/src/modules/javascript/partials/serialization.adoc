You do not need to handle serialization for messages. Kalix functions serve gRPC interfaces, and the input and output messages are `protobuf` messages that get serialized to the `protobuf` format. However, for objects to be persisted such as Event Sourced https://docs.kalix.io/reference/glossary.html#event[_events_] and https://docs.kalix.io/reference/glossary.html#snapshot[_snapshots_] you have a choice.

By default, Kalix will automatically detect if an emitted event or snapshot is a `protobuf` and handle them correctly, so we recommend using the default behavior. However, if you have specific requirements, you also can choose between primitive type and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) serialization.
