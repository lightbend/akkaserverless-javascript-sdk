= Quickstart: Shopping Cart in TypeScript

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]
include::javascript:partial$attributes.adoc[]

Learn how to create a shopping cart in TypeScript, package it into a container, and run it on Kalix.

== Before you begin

* If you're new to Kalix, https://console.kalix.io[create an account{tab-icon}, window="new"] so you can try it out for free.
* You'll also need to install the https://docs.kalix.io/kalix/install-kalix.html[Kalix CLI, window="new-doc"] to deploy from a terminal window.
* For this quickstart, you'll also need
** https://docs.docker.com/engine/install[Docker {minimum_docker_version} or higher, window="new"]
** https://nodejs.org/en/download/[Node.js {minimum_node_version}, window="new"]
** https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl#installation[`grpcurl`, window="new"]

[NOTE]
====
If you want to bypass writing code and jump straight to the deployment:

. Download the source code using the Kalix CLI:
+
[source, command line]
----
kalix quickstart download shopping-cart-typescript
----

. Skip to <<Package and deploy your service>>.
====

== Create the project structure and install dependencies

. From the command line, create a directory with the basic structure for your project using a template:
+
[source, command line]
----
npx @kalix-io/create-kalix-entity@latest shopping-cart --typescript --template basic
----

. Change into the project directory:
+
[source, command line]
----
cd shopping-cart
----

. Download and install project dependencies:
+
[source, command line]
----
npm install
----

== Define the external API

The Shopping Cart service will store shopping carts for your customers, including the items in those carts. The `shoppingcart_api.proto` will contain the external API your clients will invoke.

. Create a `proto` directory.
+
[source, command line]
----
mkdir proto
----

. Create a `shopping_cart_api.proto` file and save it in the `proto` directory.

. Add declarations for:
+
--
* The protobuf syntax version, `proto3`.
* The package name, `shopping.cart.api`.
* Import `google/api/annotations.proto`, `google/protobuf/empty.proto`, and Kalix `kalix/annotations.proto`.
--
+
[source, proto, indent=0]
.proto/shopping_cart_api.proto
----
include::javascript:example$ts-shopping-cart-quickstart/proto/shopping_cart_api.proto[tag=declarations]
----

. Add the service endpoint. The service endpoint is annotated with `kalix.codegen` indicating we want to generate an Event Sourced Entity for this service.
+
[source, proto, indent=0]
.proto/shopping_cart_api.proto
----
include::javascript:example$ts-shopping-cart-quickstart/proto/shopping_cart_api.proto[tag=service]
----

. Add messages to define the fields that comprise a `Cart` object (and its compound `LineItem`):
+
[source, proto, indent=0]
.proto/shopping_cart_api.proto
----
include::javascript:example$ts-shopping-cart-quickstart/proto/shopping_cart_api.proto[tag=messages]
----

. Add the messages that are the requests to the shopping cart service:
+
[source, proto, indent=0]
.proto/shopping_cart_api.proto
----
include::javascript:example$ts-shopping-cart-quickstart/proto/shopping_cart_api.proto[tag=method-messages]
----

== Define the domain model

The `shopping_cart_domain.proto` contains all the internal data objects (https://docs.kalix.io/reference/glossary.html#entity[Entities, window="new"]). The https://docs.kalix.io/reference/glossary.html#event_sourced_entity[Event Sourced Entity, window="new"] in this Quickstart keeps all events sent for a specific shopping cart in a journal.

. Create a `shopping_cart_domain.proto` file and save it in the `proto` directory.

. Add declarations for the proto syntax and domain package.
+
[source, proto, indent=0]
.proto/shopping_cart_domain.proto
----
include::javascript:example$ts-shopping-cart-quickstart/proto/shopping_cart_domain.proto[tag=declarations]
----

. Add the `CartState` message with fields for entity data and the `LineItem` message that defines the compound line item:
+
[source, proto, indent=0]
.proto/shopping_cart_domain.proto
----
include::javascript:example$ts-shopping-cart-quickstart/proto/shopping_cart_domain.proto[tag=state]
----

. Event Sourced entities work based on events. Add the events that can occur in this Quickstart:
+
[source, proto, indent=0]
----
include::javascript:example$ts-shopping-cart-quickstart/proto/shopping_cart_domain.proto[tag=events]
----

== Generate TypeScript implementation stubs

Run code generation to build TypeScript implementation stubs from your external API and domain model proto files.

[source, command line]
----
npm run build
----

== Implement shopping cart business logic

Fill in the implementation for the behavior of your shopping cart, which consists of Command Handlers and Event Handlers.

* Command Handlers, as the name suggests, handle incoming API requests. State is not updated directly by command handlers.
  Instead, if state should be updated, an event is persisted that describes the intended transaction.
* Event Handlers maintain the state of an entity by sequentially applying the effects of events to the local state.

//

. Open `src/shoppingcart.ts`.

. Add imports for API and domain types, which will be used later:
+
[source, typescript, indent=0]
.src/shoppingcart.ts
----
include::javascript:example$ts-shopping-cart-quickstart/src/shoppingcart.ts[tag=imports]
----

. Fill in the implementation for the behavior of your shopping cart, which will be implemented by functions added below:
+
[source, typescript, indent=0]
.src/shoppingcart.ts
----
include::javascript:example$ts-shopping-cart-quickstart/src/shoppingcart.ts[tag=setBehavior]
----

. Add the `addItem` function to handle requests to add items to a shopping cart.
+
--
* This function will handle an incoming `AddItem` request, and emit an `ItemAdded` event.
* The current state of the shopping cart is passed to the function but is not used.
* It fails the command for an invalid quantity (needs to be at least one item).
* Or it persists an `ItemAdded` event using the context `emit` effect.
--
+
[source, typescript, indent=0]
.src/shoppingcart.ts
----
include::javascript:example$ts-shopping-cart-quickstart/src/shoppingcart.ts[tag=addItem]
----

. Add the `removeItem` function to handle requests to remove items from a shopping cart.
+
--
* This function will handle an incoming `RemoveItem` request, and emit an `ItemRemoved` event.
* The current state of the shopping cart is passed and used to check the item exists.
* It fails if the item to be removed is not found in the shopping cart.
* If the item exists, it persists an `ItemRemoved` event using the context `emit` effect.
--
+
[source, typescript, indent=0]
.src/shoppingcart.ts
----
include::javascript:example$ts-shopping-cart-quickstart/src/shoppingcart.ts[tag=removeItem]
----

. Add the `getCart` function to handle requests to retrieve a shopping cart.
+
--
* This function takes the current internal state and converts it to the external API model.
* The conversion between the domain and the external API is straigtforward, as they have the same fields.
--
+
[source, typescript, indent=0]
.src/shoppingcart.ts
----
include::javascript:example$ts-shopping-cart-quickstart/src/shoppingcart.ts[tag=getCart]
----

. Add the `itemAdded` function to update the state for emitted `ItemAdded` events.
+
--
* This function first checks for an existing line item for the newly added product.
* If an existing item is found, its quantity is adjusted.
* Otherwise, the new item is added directly to the cart.
* Finally, the updated cart state is returned.
--
+
[source, typescript, indent=0]
.src/shoppingcart.ts
----
include::javascript:example$ts-shopping-cart-quickstart/src/shoppingcart.ts[tag=itemAdded]
----

. Add the `itemRemoved` function to update the state for emitted `ItemRemoved` events.
+
--
* This function removes an item from the cart, by filtering it from the cart items.
* The updated cart state is then returned.
--
+
[source, typescript, indent=0]

[NOTE]
====
The `src/index.ts` file already contains the required code to start your service and register it with Kalix.
====

== Package and deploy your service

To build and publish the container image and then deploy the service, follow these steps:

. If you haven't done so yet, sign in to your Kalix account. If this is your first time using Kalix, this will let you register an account, https://docs.kalix.io/projects/create-project.html[create your first project], and set this project as the default.
+
[source, command line]
----
kalix auth login
----

. Update the `config.dockerImage` setting in the `package.json` file with your container registry.

. Use the `deploy` script to build the container image, publish it to the container registry as configured in the `package.json` file, and then automatically https://docs.kalix.io/services/deploy-service.html#_deploy[deploy the service] to Kalix using `kalix`:
+
[source, command line]
----
npm run deploy
----

. You can https://docs.kalix.io/services/deploy-service.html#_verify_service_status[verify the status of the deployed service] using:
+
[source, command line]
----
kalix service list
----

== Invoke your service

Once the service has started successfully, you can https://docs.kalix.io/services/invoke-service.html#_testing_and_development[start a proxy locally] to access the service:

[source, command line]
----
kalix service proxy shopping-cart --grpcui
----

The `--grpcui` option also starts and opens a https://docs.kalix.io/services/invoke-service.html#_using_the_built_in_graphical_client[gRPC web UI] for exploring and invoking the service (available at http://127.0.0.1:8080/ui/).

Or you can use command line gRPC or HTTP clients, such as `grpcurl` or `curl`, to invoke the service through the proxy at `localhost:8080`, using plaintext connections.

Items can be added to a shopping cart using the `AddItem` method on the `ShoppingCart` service, in the gRPC web UI, or with `grpcurl`:

[source, command line]
----
grpcurl \
  -d '{
    "cart_id": "abc123",
    "product_id": "AAPL",
    "name": "Apples",
    "quantity": 42
  }' \
  --plaintext localhost:8080 \
  shopping.cart.api.ShoppingCart/AddItem
----

The `GetCart` method can be used to retrieve this cart, in the gRPC web UI, or with `grpcurl`:

[source, command line]
----
grpcurl \
  -d '{"cart_id": "abc123"}' \
  --plaintext localhost:8080 \
  shopping.cart.api.ShoppingCart/GetCart
----

You can https://docs.kalix.io/services/invoke-service.html#_exposing_services_to_the_internet[expose the service to the internet]. A generated hostname will be returned from the expose command:

[source, command line]
----
kalix service expose shopping-cart
----
