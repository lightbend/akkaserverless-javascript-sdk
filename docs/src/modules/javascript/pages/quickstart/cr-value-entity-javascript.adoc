= Quickstart: Customer Registry in JavaScript

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]
include::javascript:partial$attributes.adoc[]

Learn how to create a customer registry in JavaScript, package it into a container, and run it on Kalix.

== Before you begin

* If you're new to Kalix, https://console.kalix.io[create an account{tab-icon}, window="new"] so you can try it out for free.
* You'll also need to install the https://docs.kalix.io/kalix/install-kalix.html[Kalix CLI, window="new-doc"] to deploy from a terminal window.
* For this quickstart, you'll also need
** https://docs.docker.com/engine/install[Docker {minimum_docker_version} or higher, window="new"]
** https://nodejs.org/en/download/[Node.js {minimum_node_version}, window="new"]
** https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl#installation[`grpcurl`, window="new"]

[NOTE]
====
If you want to bypass writing code and jump straight to the deployment:

. Download the source code using the Kalix CLI:
+
[source,command line]
----
kalix quickstart download customer-registry-javascript
----

. Skip to <<Package and deploy your service>>.
====

== Writing the Customer Registry

. From the command line, create a directory with the basic structure for your project using a template:
+
[source,command line]
----
npx @kalix-io/create-kalix-entity@latest customer-registry --template basic
----

. Change into the project directory:
+
[source,command line]
----
cd customer-registry
----

. Download and install project dependencies:
+
[source,command line]
----
npm install
----

== Define the external API

The Customer Registry service will create or retrieve a customer, including their name, email, and mailing address. The `customer_api.proto` will contain the external API your clients will invoke.

. Create a `proto` directory.
+
[source,command line]
----
mkdir proto
----

. Create a `customer_api.proto` file and save it in the `proto` directory.

. Add declarations for:
+
* The protobuf syntax version, `proto3`.
* The package name, `customer.api`.
* Import `google/protobuf/empty.proto` and Kalix `kalix/annotations.proto`.
+
[source,proto,indent=0]
.proto/customer_api.proto
----
include::javascript:example$js-customer-registry-quickstart/proto/customer_api.proto[tag=declarations]
----

. Add the service endpoint. The service endpoint is annotated with `kalix.codegen` indicating we want to generate a Value Entity for this service.
+
[source,proto,indent=0]
.proto/customer_api.proto
----
include::javascript:example$js-customer-registry-quickstart/proto/customer_api.proto[tag=service]
----

. Add messages to define the fields that comprise a `Customer` object (and its compound `Address`):
+
[source,proto,indent=0]
.proto/customer_api.proto
----
include::javascript:example$js-customer-registry-quickstart/proto/customer_api.proto[tag=messages]
----

. Add the message that will identify which customer to retrieve for the `GetCustomer` message:
+
[source,proto,indent=0]
.proto/customer_api.proto
----
include::javascript:example$js-customer-registry-quickstart/proto/customer_api.proto[tag=method-messages]
----

== Define the domain model

The `customer_domain.proto` contains all the internal data objects (https://docs.kalix.io/reference/glossary.html#entity[Entities, window="new"]). The https://docs.kalix.io/reference/glossary.html#value_entity[Value Entity, window="new"] in this quickstart is a Key/Value store that stores only the latest updates.

. Create a `customer_domain.proto` file and save it in the `proto` directory.

. Add declarations for the proto syntax and domain package.
+
[source,proto,indent=0]
.proto/customer_domain.proto
----
include::javascript:example$js-customer-registry-quickstart/proto/customer_domain.proto[tag=declarations]
----

. Add the `CustomerState` message with fields for the customer data, and the `Address` message:
+
[source,proto,indent=0]
.proto/customer_domain.proto
----
include::javascript:example$js-customer-registry-quickstart/proto/customer_domain.proto[tag=domain]
----

. Run the `build` script from the project root directory to generate source classes, based on the protobuf definitions, in which you can add the business logic:
+
[source,command line]
----
npm run build
----

== Create command handlers

Command handlers, as the name suggests, handle incoming requests before persisting them.

. If it's not open already, open the generated `src/customer.js` file for editing.

. Modify the `Create` handler by adding the logic to handle the command. The complete function should include the following:
+
[source,javascript,indent=0]
.src/customer.js
----
include::example$js-customer-registry-quickstart/src/customer.js[tag=create]
----
+
* The incoming message contains the request data from your client and the command handler updates the state of the customer.

. Modify the `GetCustomer` handler as follows to handle the `GetCustomerRequest` command:
+
[source, javascript, indent=0]
.src/customer.js
----
include::example$js-customer-registry-quickstart/src/customer.js[tag=getCustomer]
----
+
* If that customer doesn't exist, processing the command fails.
* If the customer exists, the reply message contains the customer's information.
* The conversion between the domain CustomerState and the external API is straightforward, as they have the same fields.

[NOTE]
====
The `src/index.js` file already contains the required code to start your service and register it with Kalix.
====

== Package and deploy your service

To build and publish the container image and then deploy the service, follow these steps:

. If you haven't done so yet, sign in to your Kalix account. If this is your first time using Kalix, this will let you register an account, https://docs.kalix.io/projects/create-project.html[create your first project], and set this project as the default.
+
[source,command line]
----
kalix auth login
----

. Update the `config.dockerImage` setting in the `package.json` file with your container registry.

. Use the `deploy` script to build the container image, publish it to the container registry as configured in the `package.json` file, and then automatically https://docs.kalix.io/services/deploy-service.html#_deploy[deploy the service] to Kalix using `kalix`:
+
[source,command line]
----
npm run deploy
----

. You can https://docs.kalix.io/services/deploy-service.html#_verify_service_status[verify the status of the deployed service] using:
+
[source,command line]
----
kalix service list
----

== Invoke your service

Once the service has started successfully, you can https://docs.kalix.io/services/invoke-service.html#_testing_and_development[start a proxy locally] to access the service:

[source,command line]
----
kalix service proxy customer-registry --grpcui
----

The `--grpcui` option also starts and opens a https://docs.kalix.io/services/invoke-service.html#_using_the_built_in_graphical_client[gRPC web UI] for exploring and invoking the service (available at http://127.0.0.1:8080/ui/).

Or you can use command line gRPC or HTTP clients, such as `grpcurl` or `curl`, to invoke the service through the proxy at `localhost:8080`, using plaintext connections.

A customer can be created using the `Create` method on `CustomerService`, in the gRPC web UI, or with `grpcurl`:

[source,command line]
----
grpcurl \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "abc123",
    "email": "someone@example.com",
    "name": "Someone",
    "address": {
      "street": "123 Some Street",
      "city": "Somewhere"
    }
  }' \
  --plaintext localhost:8080 \
  customer.api.CustomerService/Create
----

The `GetCustomer` method can be used to retrieve this customer, in the gRPC web UI, or with `grpcurl`:

[source,command line]
----
grpcurl \
  -d '{"customer_id": "abc123"}' \
  --plaintext localhost:8080 \
  customer.api.CustomerService/GetCustomer
----

You can https://docs.kalix.io/services/invoke-service.html#_exposing_services_to_the_internet[expose the service to the internet]. A generated hostname will be returned from the expose command:

[source,command line]
----
kalix service expose customer-registry
----
