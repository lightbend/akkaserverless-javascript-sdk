= Developing with JavaScript

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]
include::partial$attributes.adoc[]

The Akka Serverless JavaScript SDK offers an idiomatic JavaScript language SDK for writing components. This page describes prerequisites for JavaScript development and basic requirements for a development project.

Your development project needs to include the Akka Serverless JavaScript SDK and logic to start the gRPC server. You define your components in gRPC descriptors and use `protoc` to compile them. Finally, you implement business logic for service components.

To save the work of starting from scratch, the JavaScript xref:kickstart.adoc[code generation tool] creates a project, complete with descriptors and implementations. Or, you can start from one of our https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/tutorial/index.html[example applications].

== Prerequisites

The following are required to develop services in JavaScript:

Node:: Akka Serverless requires at least Node {minimum_node_version}. You will find links to download Node https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/[here {tab-icon}, window="new"].

Build tool:: Akka Serverless does not require any particular build tool, you can select your own but out-of-the-box experience is provided in conjunction with NPM and YARN.

Docker:: Akka Serverless requires https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker {tab-icon}, window="new"] {minimum_docker_version} for building your service images. Most popular build tools have plugins that assist in building Docker images.

Since Akka Serverless is based on gRPC, you need a protoc compiler to compile gRPC protobuf descriptors. The SDK provides helper scripts to automatically download the `protoc` compiler for your platform and compile your project.

== Development project requirements

The following examples show how to install the SDK to build your services with NPM or YARM. The code generation tools include an Akka Serverless xref:kickstart.adoc[code generation tools] that generates the recommended project structure, including a `package.json` file with the necessary references.

NOTE: The code generation tools do more than just provide a starter project, after you modify a `.proto` file, they will generate code stubs for the elements you changed or added.

If you are starting from scratch, you will need to add configuration and code to:

* <<_add_sdk_libraries>>
* <<_define_grpc_descriptors_and_compile>>
* <<_create_and_start_the_grpc_server>>

== Add SDK libraries

Once you have the prerequisites, you need to add the `@lightbend/akkaserverless-javascript-sdk` package to your service development project, which can be done by running:

[source,sh,subs="attributes+"]
----
npm install akkaserverless@{akkaserverless-javascript-sdk-version} --save-exact
----

To create a basic service, you need to include the `akkaserverless` package dependencies in your project, define gRPC descriptors in `.proto` files and reference them in your project, compile the `.proto` files, and have logic to start the gRPC server in your source code.

The following shows a minimal `package.json` configuration for a shopping cart service project:


[source,json,subs="attributes+"]
----
{
  "name": "shopping-cart",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "@lightbend/akkaserverless-javascript-sdk": "{akkaserverless-javascript-sdk-version}"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "prestart": "compile-descriptor shoppingcart.proto",
    "start": "node index.js"
  }
}
----

=== Define gRPC descriptors and compile

Descriptors for gRPC are defined in `protobuf` files. You can place `protobuf` files in your project wherever you like, for example, in the root directory, or in a directory named `protos`. In the `package.json` example, above we've placed the service descriptor in a file in the root folder called `shoppingcart.proto`. See xref:proto.adoc[] for more details.

=== Precompile the protobuf descriptor set

The gRPC descriptor is serialized to binary using the Protobuf https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/techniques#self-description[`FileDescriptorSet` message type]. Akka Serverless requires that you precompile this descriptor using `protoc`. We provide a utility that does this for you. It downloads the `protoc` binary for your platform, and runs it with the necessary arguments and include paths. You can run the utility manually, or we recommend adding it as a script to the build.

To run the utility manually, invoke `node_modules/@lightbend/akkaserverless-javascript-sdk/bin/compile-descriptor.js`.


Or, add a `prestart` script to your `npm` build:

[source,json]
----
{
  "scripts": {
    "prestart": "compile-descriptor my-descriptor.proto"
  }
}
----

=== The compile-descriptor utility

Multiple protobuf files can be passed to the `compile-descriptor` utility. You can also pass any arguments accepted by `protoc`. For example, if you are importing files from other directories, you can add those directories as an include path by adding `-Ipath/to/protobuf/dir`.

By default, the descriptor is written to `user-function.desc`, if you wish to change this, you can set `--descriptor_set_out=my-descriptor.desc`. Note that if you output the descriptor to a different path, you will also need to pass that custom path to the constructor of the `Akkaserverless` class when you got to instantiate it.

=== Create and start the gRPC server

There are two ways to create and start an Akka Serverless gRPC server. The first is to create an link:{attachmentsdir}/api/module-akkaserverless.Entity.html[`Entity`{tab-icon}, window="new"], and invoke link:{attachmentsdir}/api/module-akkaserverless.Entity.html#start[`start`{tab-icon}, window="new"] on it. This allows creating a server that serves a single entity, with the default options. We'll look at this more in the subsequent pages. Alternatively, you can use the link:{attachmentsdir}/api/module-akkaserverless.AkkaServerless.html[`AkkaServerless`{tab-icon}, window="new"] class, add one or more entities to it, and then invoke link:{attachmentsdir}/api/module-akkaserverless.AkkaServerless.html#start[`start`{tab-icon}, window="new"], like so:

[source,js,indent=0]
----
include::example$test/gettingstarted/index.js[tag=start]
----

If you created your protobuf file descriptor set at a different location to the default of `user-function.desc`, you can configure that here:

[source,js,indent=0]
----
include::example$test/gettingstarted/index.js[tag=custom-desc]
----

For all options available on the `AkkaServerless` class, see link:{attachmentsdir}++/api/module-akkaserverless.AkkaServerless.html#~options++[`AkkaServerless~options`{tab-icon}, window="new"].

= Replicated entities

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

This page documents how to implement Replicated Entities in Javascript. For information on what  Replicated Entities are, please read how to https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/designing/state-model.html[choose a state model] and the general xref:developing:crdts.adoc[Replicated Entity] information first.



== Init default value of Replicated Entity

We can init the state like the following code
[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
entity.defaultValue = () => new crdt.ORSet();
----


== Handling commands

By default, the name of the command that the method handles will be the name of the method with the first letter capitalized. So, a method called `getFriends` will handle a gRPC service call command named `GetFriends`.

The command handler also can take the gRPC service call input type as a parameter to receive the command message. This is optional, sometimes it's not needed.

The return type of the command handler must be the output type for the gRPC service call, this will be sent as the reply.

The following shows the implementation of the command handlers. In the following example, the command handlers `add` and `remove` update the state in Replicated Entity:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
function add(friend, ctx) {
  ctx.state.add(friend.friend);
  return {};
}

function remove(friend, ctx) {
  ctx.state.delete(friend.friend);
  return {};
}

function getFriends(user, ctx) {
  console.log("getFriends for user: "+ user, {
    friends: Array.from(ctx.state)
  });
  return {
    friends: Array.from(ctx.state)
  };
}

entity.commandHandlers = {
  Add: add,
  Remove: remove,
  GetFriends: getFriends
};
----

== Streamed command handlers

Replicated Entities support streaming over gRPC. Streamed commands can be used to receive and publish updates to the state. The detail is in link:{attachmentsdir}/api/module-akkaserverless.replicatedentity.ReplicatedEntityCommandContext.html[`ReplicatedEntityCommandContext`{tab-icon}, window="new"].
